        <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
        conversation?' <br /><br />So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
        of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.<br /><br />In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
        in the world she was to get out again.<br /><br />The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
        well.</p>
